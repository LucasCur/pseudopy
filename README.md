`Current Version: v1.3`

# PseudoPY üó∫Ô∏è
- The only usable pseudopy file extensions are `.pseudopy` and `.pspy`.
- All pseudocode must be contained within a `main.pspy` file with any suitable pseudopy file extension, or will not be ran by the parser.
- All normal python syntax is still functional and available.
- Indents are no longer neccesary for code to function, however still **highly** recommended as this feature is experimental and may introduce errors to code when used.
- All new pseudocode alternative syntax can be found under the **"Syntax"** section.

## Syntax üì∞
- **[v1.0]** [PSPY] By default, the `pspy_ver` float variable will be predefined as the current PseudoPY version.
 
- **[v1.0]** [ENDING DENOTATION] `endwhile`, `endfunction`, `endif`, `next i`, etc. can all be used to denote the end of a statement, loop or function.

- **[v1.0]** [FUNCTIONS] The keyword `function` can be used as an alternative to `def` when defining functions.

- **[v1.1]** [FOR LOOPS] `for x = y to z` can be used instead of `for x in range(y,z)`.

- **[v1.1]** [ANTI-REPLACE] If the parser, for example, changed all instances of one word to another, such as "function" to "def" `(which is done by PseudoPY to allow you to define functions using the keyword function instead of def)`, you are able to revert this for specific instances by including a **$** after the changed word, which will prevent the change and remove itself after doing so, leaving the word unchanged in the final parsed code that is ran. If however, you do want a **visible** **$** to come after the word for whatever reason and this is now preventing that, simply add another **$** as if the first one you added doesn't exist. **This is applicable to most cases when words may be changed/replaced throughout your use of PseudoPY, not just with the word "function", which was used only as an example in this situation.**

## Example Usage ü™Å

- Example #1 `(For Loops)`
```
for i = 0 to 5:
  print(i)
next i
```

- Example #2 `(While Loops & If Statements)`
```
x = True
y = 0
while x == True:
  y += 1
  print(y)
  if y >= 5:
    x = False
  endif
endwhile
```

- Example #3 `(Functions & For Loops & Anti-Replace)`
```
function funcName(argument):
  for i = 0 to argument:
    print("the function$ says:")
    print(i)
  next i
endfunction

funcName(10)
```

## Changelog üßæ
- **[v1.1]** Overhauled old, rudimentary for loop system to allow any variable to be the iterator and any variable or value to be the beginning or ending parameters.
- **[v1.1]** Implemented $ system (Anti-Replace) to allow for exclusions to be made to how the parser replaces certain words to allow the pseudocode to run in python.
- **[v1.2]** Implemented the shortened file extension `.pspy` as an alternative to `.pseudopy`, and by default it will take prioritory over its lengthier counterpart.
- **[v1.3]** Revamped the way the parser checks if a line of code is an end statement to avoid situations similar to why I made the Anti-Replace $ method, where the parser mistakes a string as something it needs to change for the code to function. `(As well as to clean up the code's messiness)`

## ARCHIVED INFORMATION üì¶
- **[ARCHIVE-DATE] [ARCHIVE-VERSION] [ARCHIVE-REASON] [INFO-TYPE]** INFORMATION 
- **[05/11/22] [v1.1] [Newer, improved system added] [FOR LOOPS]** `= x to y` can be used instead of `in range(x,y)`.
